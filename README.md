Mako support for Flask is provided by https://github.com/tzellman/flask-mako. All rights belong to the original author and this set of codes merely provides an easier way to create a virtual environment with Mako support for Flask using his techniques.

It is best to run this program in a virtualenv to prevent clashes with your own settings =)
